-- the tag, or a key-value pair, associating entities with a specific slice of
-- a larger categorization.
--
-- As strings, the key and value parts of a key-value pair are separated by a
-- (':'). As such, any tag with no colons is a label, and any tag with one (or
-- more) is a key-value pair - if more than one ':' is specified, the
-- additional ':'s will become part of the value.
